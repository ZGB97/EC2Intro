<h1> Deploying a Web Server on AWS EC2 Instance (AWS) </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I signed into the AWS Management Console and launched an EC2 instance with the specs I needed. Then, I used SSH to connect to the instance with my key pair. Once I was in, I installed Apache and made sure it starts on boot. After that, I created a simple web page and published it on the server. To wrap it up, I validated my setup by accessing the web page through the EC2 instance's public DNS.
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Amazon Web Services (AWS) Management Console: For launching and managing the EC2 instanc.</b>
- <b>Secure Shell (SSH): For securely connecting to the EC2 instance</b>
- <b>Apache HTTP Server: For hosting the web server.</b>
- <b>HTML: For creating the web page content.</b>
- <b>Linux Command Line: For installing software and managing the server</b>
